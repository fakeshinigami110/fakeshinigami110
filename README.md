# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ali Yaghoubi

### 🧠 About Me
I'm a software engineering student with a growing passion for Edge AI, IoT, and Machine Learning.  
Previously focused on Telegram bot development and backend with Django, I'm now shifting toward AI at the edge — where intelligence meets hardware.  
My long-term ambition is to become a computer engineer specializing in Edge AI and pursue a Master’s degree in Japan through the MEXT scholarship.

### 🔭 Current Focus
- 📘 Studying Machine Learning fundamentals using structured courses and real projects  
- 🧠 Learning how to deploy AI models on edge devices with a focus on C++ and Python  
- 🛠️ Planning to gain hands-on experience in electronics and embedded systems soon  
- 🚀 Long-term project: Building a real-time 3D communication system using image processing & edge computing

### 💻 Skills & Tools
- Languages: Python, C++, (learning Rust), Bash  
- AI & ML: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib  
- Backend: Django (basic), PostgreSQL (proficient)  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Linux (Ubuntu), Docker  
- IoT (upcoming): Planning to explore Python & Go for device communication and control

### 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Short-Term:  
  - Master core Machine Learning concepts  
  - Prototype a mini edge ML project (TinyML or image classification on edge)  
- 🚀 Mid-Term:  
  - Learn embedded systems and electronics  
  - Start combining ML models with hardware (MCUs, sensors, etc.)  
- 🗾 Long-Term:  
  - 🇯🇵 Win the MEXT scholarship  
  - Become an expert in Edge AI + IoT systems
